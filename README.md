# Groovy basics vs Java

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for:
Groovy basics is a project for seen the diferences between Java and Groovy,




- You can suppress the "public" from methods and classes because Groovy sets it by default

- getters and setters are defined by default

- You do not have to define the type of the attributes, "def" is used to name them and at runtime, it is defined, this can generate errors when running the code that cannot be seen in the compilation.

- The constructors of the methods are self-generated and can be performed by building on the parameters of the object instance.

- the last event (linecode)of a method that have to return any value(not a void) will be returned as default, so that means you dont need to put the return on the last line
- you don't need to use semicolons
- DINAMIC
- the asign of Hasmap is like python or like json structure
- "secure navigation"
- Operators
	- (ELVIS)
	- IN-> for see if an element appears in a list 
	- IT-> multiply any value 
- Strings
	- similar to  javascript
	- Slashyany type of ""'``' between /""/
	- Gstrings-groovy strings let you define variables and methods inside a string         with $and with  ${ code to execute}    
	- Base64    
- Closures
	- Closure --> def sumador = {a,b -> a+b}
	- it
	- Curry(functional programming)
		- curry()
		- rcurry()
	- Memoize
		- "clean the repetitive code and faster"
- LISTS Y MAPS 
	- data searchers 
		- list.find{it==" what you want "}
		- list.findAll{condicion}
		- list.findLastIndexOf{condicion}
	 - iterators  
		 - numbers have times() 
		 - the  each method for iterate without stoping
